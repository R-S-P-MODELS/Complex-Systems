# Complex-Systems
shiny R examples of complex systems

This is a shinyApp that explores several problems in theoretical and experimental physics that a undergraduate student may see during the course

It also contains simulations on the field of complex systems which is a field of research i focused during my undergrad studies

Some applications were written in C, these will only work on a linux machine since the R shiny interface is just a graphical interface for the C code

And the code will be compiled by gcc before to run in the machine

the user may see how these simulations behave when changing the inputs and understand these problems by their numerical solutions

to run this app use:

shiny::runGitHub(repo="Complex-Systems",username="R-S-P-MODELS")
